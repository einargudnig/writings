<p>Once again I'm writing to tell you about my new homepage ðŸ˜¬</p>

<p>This one is far far way from being ready. But there is no need in keeping hidden until it's perfect, because nothing is perfect.</p>

<p>I am that 'shiny new toy'-type that always wants to try out every new thing under the sun.</p>
<p class="mt-2">Especially if I'm excited about said thing. But I try to be conscious about and I have many time decided not to do to much changes to my page.</p>

<p class="mt-2">I was very happy with my old page. The reason for why I'm building a new one is simple</p>


<SubHeading>
  TypeScript
</SubHeading>

<p>My old site was not written in TypeScript and I had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to convert it.</p>
<p class="mt-2">In my opinion TypeScript **is** the way. And there is not a better way to get better at things other than putting in the reps.</p>


<p>Instead of rewriting the old one I thought of using this as a place to put down some good seeds: Use TypeScript, refresh the design and try out some new things.</p>
<p class="mt-2">I want to continue to build my digital garden, this digital garden is just for fun but, I want to use it deliberately to improve my skill.</p>

<p class="mt-2">So now I can proudly say that I've planted the first seed to my new digital garden. I have so many ideas I want to try out. Some them will probably</p>
<p>not work and I will never publish some of them. But that is what it takes to grow a balanced, beautiful garden.</p>

<p class="mt-2">If you didn't notice it sooner this page heavily influenced by how [Lee Robinsons's page](https://leerob.io/) used to look.</p>
<p class="mt-2">I really really liked the design of it. So I used his design as a starting point. I will make it different over time.</p>

<p class="mt-2">I'm going to quickly go over these first seeds that I planted. I might go more in depth in future posts.</p>

<SubHeading>
  Next.js
</SubHeading>

<p>Tried out the new App router.</p>
<p class="mt-2">I have mixed feelings about it, but overall I like it.</p>

<SubHeading>
  ContentLayer
</SubHeading>

<p>For my markdown blog posts.</p>
<p class="mt-2">Just so it's clear markdown is fantastic.</p>

<SubHeading>
  Tailwind
</SubHeading>

<p>I've been using Tailwind at my daily job for almost three years and I love it.</p>

<SubHeading>
  Shadcn-ui
</SubHeading>

<p>This is such an interesting project.
I like the copy-paste mentality of it. It's easy to select the components that I want.</p>

<SubHeading>
  PlanetScale
</SubHeading>

<p>I did not have any database in my old site. I wanted to try out PlanetScale and I'm very happy with it so far.</p>

<p class="mt-2">I'm not going to have this longer since I'm going to start on one of my side projects now.</p>
