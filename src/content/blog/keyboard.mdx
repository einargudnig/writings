  <p class="mt-2">No editing, little to no proofreading and hopefully no typos.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">There is something about writing on a mechanical keyboard. The feel, the sound, all of it is so satisfying.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">Now I have Keychorn Q8 Pro that I use at home. I've made some updates to it.</p>

    I've made some minor configrations to this keyboard, so the right side space bar is enter, the right side fn2 is backspace.
    This allowes me to use the keyboard without needing to reach the pinky finger all the way to the top right.

    <p class="mt-2">While writing this review I had one glass of red wine, a 2020 La grola.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">It was a good wine, from Northern Italy, I haven't tasted many wines with the Corvina grapes, so this was a nice surprise.</p>
