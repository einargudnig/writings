<MarkdownPostLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>

<p>I started reading the Rust documentation couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Lot of interesting things are being built with Rust and I thought I'd hop on the wagon.</p>
<p>I'll add some interesting thoughts, ideas and wanderings here.</p>

<p class="mt-4">ðŸš§ This post is a work in progress ðŸš§</p>

<ul class="mt-4 ml-4">
<li>- The Rust docs ship locally with Rust when you download it.</li>
<li>- Rust requires curly brackets around functions body.</li>
</ul>
