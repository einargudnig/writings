<p>I Recently  built a <InlineLink href="https://remix-workbook.fly.dev/">learnings page</InlineLink>.</p>

<p class="my-2">Itâ€™s based on <InlineLink href="https://buildui.com/courses/ship-an-app-with-remix">Build-UI Remix course</InlineLink>.</p>

<p>Here I will curate interesting things, things I do at work and things I learn.
_This could be whatever I find interesting, doesnâ€™t need to be software related._</p>

<p class="mt-2">The plan is to send out monthly highlights where I share three things from each category, hence the triple three name</p>

<p class="mt-2">I set up a small email service using Resend so you can subscribe to these highlights</p>

<p class="mt-2">This email will contain three items from each category, so nine items in total, Iâ€™ll give some more context for these items, if needed.</p>

<p class="mt-4 font-semibold">Feel free to subscribe ðŸ¤—</p>
