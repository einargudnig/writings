<SubHeading>
  Who hasn't thought about building and publishing an app?
</SubHeading>

<div>

<p class="mt-3">
  I have at least thought about, started that process but never finished.
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  Now I'm going to go through this process, build a mobile app from scratch and publish to the app store.
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  I would like for this app to be a real app and hopefully with some users.
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  I don't want to spend too much time on building the app, but I also want to make sure the fundations are good enough to iterate on and last.
  </p>

<p class="mt-3">
  I know this might be overkill, but this is also a personal expiremet on how diciplined I can be on following through on the plan.
  This is also a great expirement for me too see how good I am at estimating and planning. Will be missing some major things?
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  It would be fantastic to be able to recruit some users to see how the decision I make will pan out. 
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  I know I will make some wrong decisions and it will be great to look back at my reasoning in these writings.
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  All this I will write for you here to follow along. Please let me know if you have any input!
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  To help me do this I wil be using <InlineLink href="htpps://linear.app">Linear</InlineLink> and their built-in cycles.
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  I feel like it is a overengineering to use cycles, one a side project, with only me ðŸ˜¬
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  But the idea of having to plan tasks on cycles in the future helps me stick to plan and hopefully I can quickly write of tasks that I feel like I don't need by simply removing them from my cycle.
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  There are loads of other things I like about linear, but let's talk about that later ðŸ¤«
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  I'll use these posts to write my public 'changelog'/releasa notes - Here I will discuss some updates, decisions and what is upcoming!
</p>

<p class="mt-3">
  I will use <InlineLink href="https://expo.dev">Expo</InlineLink> to build the mobile app and <InlineLink href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</InlineLink> as the database.
</p>
</div>


<div class="my-2">
  The first cycle is all about prep work and planning.
  These tasks migh seem minor and not important so early in the porcess. But I feel like it will be nice to have some of them out of the way.
  And by leveraging the cycles I set myself a tight time frame to finish these tasks.
</div>

<ul class="my-2">
  <li>- Set up an expo project</li>
  <li>- Set up github repo</li>
  <li>- Set up mobile emulator</li>
  <li>- Decide color theme</li>
  <li>- Wireframes for the app screens</li>
  <li>- Decide on design system</li>
  <li>- Set up database schema</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-semibold">
  The first cycle begins tomorrow. Look forward to hear from you when it is over!
