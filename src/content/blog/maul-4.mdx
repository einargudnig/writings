This October I selebrated 4 years working at Maul. ðŸ¥³

What a party! ðŸŽ‰
Four years of learning, growing, and having fun with my colleagues.
I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects with a diverse group of people.

I've learned a lot about software development, and I've grown as a developer.

I've had the opportunity to work on some really cool projects.
