<SubHeading>
  Cycle 1
</SubHeading>

<div class="mt-2">

<p class="mt-2">I started the cycle off well.</p>

Set up a expo roject, spent some time reading the docs

Decided to use the tabs example they have LINK

Set up a color scheme, decided to use Flexoki color scheme LINK

This is an easy on the eyes, simple and nice looking color scheme.

After I added the color scheme I started to add one new tab.

I think three bottom navigated tabs will be enough.

next up was to get authentication out of the way.

Decided to use Clerk, heard it's easy to use.

Set up Clerk acocunt, added package and started reading through their documentation.

Quite straight forward, had to mix it up with the expo app router to get the correct flow. But now it's set up and I'm in the work of getting it to work.

I still need to decide if this will be the user authentication flow of the app.

Next cycle will start tomorrow. In the next cycle the biggest task is to build the database, connect it to the project and start reading from it and writing to it!
