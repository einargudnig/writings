  Cycle 1

<div class="mt-2">

<p class="mt-2">I started the cycle off well.</p>

Set up a expo roject, spent some time reading the docs

Connected the the expo project to my expo account.

Now I can use EAS to help me build and deploy the app, more on that late. 

Decided to use the tabs example they have LINK

Set up a color scheme, decided to use Flexoki color scheme LINK

This is an easy on the eyes, simple and nice looking color scheme.

After I added the color scheme I started to add one new tab.

I think three bottom navigated tabs will be enough.

next up was to get authentication out of the way.

Decided to use Clerk, heard it's easy to use.

Set up Clerk acocunt, added package and started reading through their documentation.

Quite straight forward, had to mix it up with the expo app router to get the correct flow. But now it's set up and I'm in the work of getting it to work.

I still need to decide if this will be the user authentication flow of the app.

I am working on creating custom re-usable components to use in the app.

Inputs and Buttons for example, this will help keeping consistency in the UI.

I want the Log-in and Sign-up to be as good as finished, ui wise. So I can spend the next cycles focusing on other screens of the app.

I also started to build the main screens in the app.
I had to import a third party package to build a dropdown to use.


I might want to add another team login? That might be a simpler way to start, instead of needing to add the teams to the users and building a screen to connect those together

I have started to draft out a reasonable database schema, I'll spend some time in this upcoming cycle to improve it and add a database to the app.


I should make a logo, no need for it yet, but I have the colorscheme, I have some idea about how I want the logo to be: minimal and simple. I'll try to make it on my own, or get somehelp ðŸ¤ .

Next cycle will start tomorrow. In the next cycle the biggest task is to build the database, connect it to the project and start reading from it and writing to it!
