  <p class="mt-2">I feel like my fundamentals are not as strong as they should be. So I have been putting some work towards improving them.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">Here, I will dump all the things I have done. For the time being this will be dumped from my notes, I might edit it later for more clarity.</p>

  Scope and 'closures'

  <p class="mt-2">
    I was sometimes thinking about upper and lower scope, but it's always outer and inner!

    Every binding(1) has a scope and the scope is the part of the code where said binding is visible(accessible).

    Bindings that are declared inside a function can only be referenced inside that function - local bindings.

    Each scope can "look around", into the scope around it, the outer scope.


  </p>


  functions, higher order functions

  <p class="mt-2">
    When using higher-order functions we are passing functions as arguments to other functions or returning functions from functions.

    When passing a function to another function we are passing the function definition, not the invocation! For example, when using .map we are passing the function definition to the map method.
    We are not in control when the function is invoked, the method that we are passing the function to is in control.

    Same applies when we are returning functions from other functions. We are not in control when the function is invoked.
    
  </p>


  <p class="mt-2">
    `return` is a keyword used to “stop” the execution of a function. No code after the return keyword will be ran.

    The return keyword is also used to return a value from a function.
    *If a function does not have the return keyword it returns `undefined`*
    We can return objects and array
    We can return functions and create *closures*
    We can early return from a function by using conditional statements
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    `continue` is used in loops to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one!

    terminates current execution of the statement and continues in the iteration

  </p>

  data structures
  object & arrays -> main methods
  object & arrays utility methods

  map & set

  destructuring
