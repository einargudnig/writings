<SubHeading>Cycle 2</SubHeading>

<div class="mt-2">
  <p class="mt-2">
    This cycle started well.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    My girlfriend got an acute appendicitis and had to have an emergency surgery.
    So a weekend and most part of a week was spent assisting her revocer from surgery.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    Luckily she is recovering well and is doing better every day.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    I had some to think and decied to change the authentication flow.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt-2">
    The reason to change it was to update the user experience. I want multiple users to be able to add fines for
    a single team. I though I could just add a team login after the user logs in but that sounds tedious.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    Instead I decided to just allow the user to create the team. This user can later
    invite users to be a part of the team.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    I think this is a better user experience and will allow for more flexibility.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    I also decied to switch out Clerk for authentication. After all the setup ðŸ¤¡
    I am going to use Supabase for all the database stuff and figured it would be 
    nice to use their authentication as well.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    This cycle was mostly spent on improving the UI and update the authenitcation.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt-2">
    Towards the end of the cycle I got a new project to finish as a contractor.
    So this is on ice until it is done.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt-2">
    I even got another exciting project in the works, if that happens I'll postpone
    this one even more, but I still have the goal to finish this one, now the time domain
    to finish it has changed. If I go forward with this new project I might attack this one
    as a 'hackathon project' and allocate a weekend here and there to work on it!
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    But to be clear I am by no means giving up, I have an eaven clearer prject in mind now.
  </p>
