<SubHeading>Advent of neovim</SubHeading>
<Draft />

<div class="mt-2">

  <p class="mt-2">
    For the last couple of months I have been using neovim as my editor in my personal projects.
    It has it's pros and cons, and I'm trying to move most of my coding over to neovim. I have even added
    the vim extenstion to VS Code to use the keyboard movements from vim.

  <p class="mt-2">
    TJ DeVries just released a youtube series <InlineLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQn2hJeHQbM&list=PLep05UYkc6wTyBe7kPjQFWVXTlhKeQejM">Advent of Neovim</InlineLink>
    And for those who don't know, TJ is one of the maintainer of neovim. He knows his stuff.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt-2">There is something so satisfying seeing a developer gracefully using neovim to write code, being competent at using neovim looks like a real flow state.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">Here are couple of vidoes of very compitent neovim users:</p>
  <ul class="mt-2">

  </ul>

  <p class="mt-2">I'm not going to go over every single step in this series. I encourage you to check it out for yourself!</p>

  <SubHeading>Day 1 - Introduction</SubHeading> 

  <p class="mt-2">Set up a clean instance of neovim!</p>
  <p class="mt-2">Go over the basics of neovim, saving</p>

  <SubHeading>Day 2 - Nvim tutor</SubHeading>
  <p class="mt-2">The neovim tutor is a great place to start playing around.</p> 
  <p class="mt-2">I think the true magic of neovim shines when you start to get comfortable using the keyboard navigation.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">I played around in the tutor for a while when I started and it helped me a lot. I still have so much to learn.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">I still haven't re-mapped my arrow keys, so I have them function regularly, in some time I'll re-map them to something else.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">Like Tj mentions you should re-visit the tutor every now and than to continue improving your skill.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">I added the vim extension to both VS Code and Obsidian to help me get better at using the vim keybindings.</p>

  <SubHeading>Day 3 - Lua Crash Course</SubHeading>

  <p class="mt-2">Points about Lua</p>
  <ul class="mt-2">
    <li>Lua is designed to be embedded</li>
    <li>-- lua comment</li>
    <li>local string = "hello world" ‚Üí local variable</li>
    <li>functions are first class</li>
    <li>tables are effectively the only data structure</li>
    <li>tables can be used as lists or map</li>
    <li>Lua is one indexed üëÄ</li>
    <li>Control flow ‚Üí for loops, if statements</li>
    <li>Modules are files</li>
    <li>Lua is not much for using parenthesis or brackets</li>
    <li>Lua is used to configure neovim!</li>
  </ul>

  <SubHeading>Day 4 - lazy.nvim</SubHeading>

  <p class="mt-2">Lazy is a package manager, you use package manager to install plugins.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">This video goes over setting up the package manager.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">We even add our first plugin, a new color theme üíÖüèº</p>

  <SubHeading>Day 5 - neovim options</SubHeading>

  <p class="mt-2">We can set up options for certain languages</p>

  <SubHeading>Day 6 - Treesitter</SubHeading>
  

  <SubHeading>Conclusion</SubHeading>

  <p class="mt-2">I need to add or create some configs so I can use neovim for my daily work, after that the only thing missing is the Live share extension we use in VS code.</p>

  <p class="mt-2">This video series from TJ is a great way to dip your feet into the neovim world</p>
