<div class="mb-4">
<p>Last month I finished rebuilding the <InlineLink href="https://gigover.com/">Gigover</InlineLink> landing page.</p>

<p class="mt-3">Like with most projects there comes a time when it needs to be updated.</p>
<p>I have worked as a free-lance developer for Gigover for a year and and a half and most spent most time on the system, so now it was time to give the ladning page some well-deserved love.</p>

<p class="mt-4">I got the design from a designer ina figma file and got to work.</p>
<p>The old page was written in Next.js and used styled components. The first step was to update packages adnv versions.</p>

<p>I wanted to update the project and use Chakra-UI, since the system is using that ui library. And I think it's goos to have it be the same in both projects.</p>
