<div class="mb-4">
<p>I am by no means a coffee expert, but I would label myself a big hobbyist.</p>
<p>I love a good cup of coffee but I'm also interested in the brewing, the methods, different tools, different beans, etc.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
<p>This is the brew I make almost every morning!</p>
<p>I love to have a milk based drink early in the morning, so I try to make a espresso with my Aeropress</p>

<p class="mt-2">For this I use a darker roast of beans, but no specific ones, I love to try new beans.</p>
<p>I use a <InlineLink href="https://www.timemore.com/collections/coffee-grinder-manual/products/timemore-chestnut-c2-max-manual-coffee-grinder">Timemore Chestnut C2 hand grinder</InlineLink>, and for this brew I have it set up for 10 clicks. So it's pretty fine grind.</p>

<ul class="my-4">
  <li>- The inverted Aeropress is the way to go here.</li>
  <li>- Around 18gr of coffee</li>
  <li>- Add the coffee to the inverted Aeropress</li>
  <li>- Add 90gr of water</li>
  <li>- Stir to remove any clumps</li>
  <li>- Fasten the cap with the pre-rinsed filter</li>
  <li>- Let it sit for around minute</li>
  <li>- Slowly press the coffee to the cup.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I have stirred the coffee I turn on the milk frother to froth the Oatly iKaffe milk.
I've found that this milk is both very good and froths well.</p>
</div>

<p>This combo is great! I look forward to have it every morning.</p>

<p>The hand grinding and manually making this cup of coffee is good morning ritual to start the morning!</p>
